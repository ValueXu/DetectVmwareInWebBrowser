# Detect Vmware in Web Browser

## Attention

I did nothing special to this, just writed a class using javascript, **even no function available tests**.
I upload this just because I don't get any obvious information while searching the keywords on GitHub.
**I hope it can warns people that there's some easy way to detect Vmware in Web browser.**
And the idea comes from this [website](https://bannedit.github.io/Virtual-Machine-Detection-In-The-Browser.html).

## Usage

Import this .js file, instantiate and use it. You can add virtual machine names array using constructor. (I hope it will work)

## Thanks

Thx to the research of [bannedit](https://bannedit.github.io/Virtual-Machine-Detection-In-The-Browser.html) and my roommate.
